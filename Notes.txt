TFT control with CS tied to GND:

These Adafruit modules solve the CS pin problem and have an onboard micro SD
card slot, but they're very expensive. We could make different carrier
boards for this or the dodgy AliExpress ones that don't have CS. Maybe a
tri-state buffer on the carrier board to avoid having to rework the cheap
displays?

Pins required:
Pin  ESP32          LCD
1    GND            GND
2    3.3V           VCC (should be compatible with either 3.3V or 5V)
3    IO18_SCLK      TFT_SCLK
4    IO23_COPI      TFT_COPI

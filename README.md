Universal Rack Controller
=========================

Copyright 2021 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd  www.superhouse.tv

A general purpose control board for rack mount projects.

DIY rack-mount projects often require an Ethernet connection, a
status display, power regulation, and other features that are not
specific to the project.

This board fits into a rack-mount case and provides those common
features so they don't have to be recreated every time.

Features:

 * RJ45 socket for Ethernet.
 * Support for both DIY (12/24V) PoE and 802.3af POE.
 * 1.3" LCD.
 * ESP32 microcontroller with WiFi.
 * Breakouts for ESP32 I/O and power.
